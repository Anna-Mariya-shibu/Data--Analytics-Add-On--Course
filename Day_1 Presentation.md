## Introduction

- Descriptive statistics (in the broad sense of the term) is a branch of statistics aiming at summarizing, describing and presenting a series of values or a dataset.

- Descriptive statistics is often the first step and an important part in any statistical analysis.

- It allows to check the quality of the data and it helps to “understand” the data by having a clear overview of it.
